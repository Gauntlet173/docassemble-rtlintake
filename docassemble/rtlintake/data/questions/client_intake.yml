field: intro
question: Introduction
subquestion: |
  Thank you for using the Round Table Law Estate Intake Tool.
  
  This is a very short interview that will ask you a few short questions to help us generate a retainer letter
  for you. We wouldn't bother with the paperwork if it weren't absolutely necessary, sorry.
  
  You can sign the retainer letter right in this tool, without ever having to print anything out. It will be sent
  back to me, and I can sign it electronically, too, and then you will get the copy with both signatures in your
  email. That will let us get started.
  
  Please note that the information you put into this interview will be accessible to Round Table Law.
  Because you are not yet our client, you should not put anything confidential in this system.
  
  If you're not sure how to answer a question, send me an email at jason@roundtablelaw.ca and I'll help you out.
  
  You can stop the interview and come back to it at any time.  Just go to [docs.roundtablelaw.ca](https://docs.roundtablelaw.ca), log in, and you
  will be shown your interviews that are already underway.  Your data will stay for 30 days after the last time
  you use the interview, after which it will be deleted for your protection.

  Thank you for agreeing to the Legal Services Agreement.

  a prompt response time, but it may take until the next business day.
  
  Thanks for your patience.

  you will receive an email notifying you to return to the interview, and providing a link.
